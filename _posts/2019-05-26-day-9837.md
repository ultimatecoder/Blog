A day was a bit lazy day. I spent almost half of my day by talking with Dhavan
or my fiance. We talked on many topics. I don't think I was able to give my
full attention to my fiance, but I am sure I will try to give her full of my
attention. She is a wonderful women and most prestijious person in my life.

I tried to write a blog post describing Aruba. Aruba is a behaviour driven test
utlity based on Cucumber for command line utilities. After writing a few words,
I realized it would be better to explain it as a video rather than a long blog
post. The demonstration has long coding samples. It would be difficult to just
place them whole togather. I have completed 40% of my blog post. I will try to
take a suggestion from Dhavan. I personally think I should record a video of it
and share that video along with a blog post. It will help them to understand
the purpose of functional tests better. Creating and sharing a dedicated code
repository will be even more helpful.

I was watched an episod of [Bloomberg's Game changer documentry series based on
Mark Zuckerberg][bloomberg_documentry]. I am always inspired by the work of
Mark Zuckerberg. He is one of the good hackers from which I have motivated. I
have deleted my Facebook acocunt few months back for an privacy reasons, but I
still admire Mark Zuckerberg for his hacky nature. After that I spent my time
watching few videos from [Life at Google][life_at_google_youtube]. Especially
[Interview tips from Google Software
Engineers][interview_tips_from_google_software_engineer]. That video instructs
to prepare from [Google's tech guide][google_tech_guide]. The tech guide looks
like a good resource. I should try to solve the problems given there.

That's it for the day. I am going to sleep now.
