## Morning

I woke up around 8 AM. I spent enough 1 or 1.30 hours over Twitter. I think I
have to stop spending my so important time on Twitter.

## First Half

I solved Saumya (the intern at Workbench project) on solving her alignment
problem of elements.

### Cards

I wasn't aware that bootstrap4 has a new classes. `Card` is one of them. Card is
a css class which makes a visual of card.

Below are classes that I have observed today

* `card-deck`

This clas will have child as `card` classes. This class will arrange all child
card classes in one row.

* `card`

This class is a base class. It should be assigned to a `div` where all other
elements will be child of it.


* `card-body`

This class should be a child class of `card`. It should be used for wrapping a
title and text of a card. `card-title` and `card-text` will be child of
`card-body` class.

* `card-title`

This class should be used to wrap the title of the card.

* `card-text`

Text of a card will be wrapped under this class.

* `card-footer`

This class should be arranged after `card-body` class. This class is responsibl
for wrapping text which will be at fotter.

* `card-image-top`

This class will align the image at the top of the card. This doesn't require a
`div` tag. You should apply this class to a `img` tag directly.

Example:

```
<div class="card-deck">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="..." class="card-img-top"/>
    <div class="card-title">
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      This is a body of the card
    </div>
    <div class="card-footer">
      This is a footer
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Object tag

Saumya had embedded bunch of SVG images inside a `Object` tag. I has never heard
of this tag. You can use object tag to embeded any document which is external of
source. You can embed videos, images or Adobe flash thing inside it.


## Second half

I watched a beautiful game of cricket. India lost against New Zeeland with 31
runs. This was a semi final game of world cup 2019. The rain interrupted
Yesterday's play where New Zeeland were at 211-6 wickets, 46.1 overs. Because of
rain the game resumed today. Today they did 239 in 8 wickets in 50 overs. New
Zeeland did their best bowling I can see. They got out India's top order best
mans with a score of 1 run. Virat kohli, KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma was out at a
score of just one run. Bolt did good bowling by being economy bowler  and Hannry
did best of his wicket taking bowling.

We were struggling, but Ravindra Jadeda, what a player he is. He stroke 77 in
nearly 56 bowls. He gave us some hope. I wish Sanjay Manjrekar says sorry to
Ravindra Jadeda for his comments on him publicly. Dhoni did 50 runs, but he got
run out. Next world cup is in India year 2023.

I literally cried. My team was playing so well, they were first in this
tournament. It is a knock out match and they are out now. It feels bad and I am
sure our plays have felt it too.
