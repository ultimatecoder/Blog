## Morning

I had decided to woke up at 5:30 AM. I was awake by an alarm too, but I slept
till 8.00 AM. Did heavy breakfast and now it is 11:00 AM and I am at office.
Today I have decided to solve data structure and algorithm questions asked to me
during my Commerce IQ interview. I will solve question number four of Cracking
the coding interview as a System Design question.
