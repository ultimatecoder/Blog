## Morning

I woke up at 8.30 AM sharp. After that I crawled Twitter for almost 1 and half
hour. I am spending too much time on Twitter. I should quite Twitter from
Today.


## First half

While reading packaging guidelines from https://packaging.python.org, I got a
trouble, cable of my laptop charger got electric shock and it burnt. There was
no battery left. I had to book an Uber and go to SP road computer market and
buy a new cable.

Cable took 120 rupees. Cab (Uber pool) costed 89 rupees and return auto from
the market to Ulsoor metro station took 75 rupees. I spent around 284 rupees
for one cable. I took nearly two hours to go to the market and come back. What
an waste of money and time.

I could have inquired nearby computer shop and tried to get a cable. If the
cable was not solving a problem, I could have decided to get a new charger. But
instead of that, I directly went to the market.

if-else statements. It was mentioned that this pattern is purely a noob pattern
and it does not convey with Open Close principle. I don't know what Open close
principle is. I will try to read it tomorrow.

As I have understood Yesterday, a factory pattern will have a method which is
responsible for 


## Tomorrow

* Read Open close principle
