Beautiful 2017 has already started. While everybody is busy with preparing 
resolutions for their new year I decided to look back and share my journey
here.

After attending [PyCon India 2015](https://in.pycon.org/2015/) India 2015 I
took an oath to spread the word of Python. It was looking simple at first
glance with a guess of getting less invitations. But the estimate went wrong.
Below is the summary of yearly progress highlight with word of experience.

During my last year I conducted 13 workshops at various colleges of
state Gujarat and Rajasthan. 10 workshops were conducted targeting college
students and 3 were presented for professionals. Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad
received 4 number of workshops individually. Did single workshop at Bhuj,
Ajmer, Vadodara and New delhi. One over Google Hangouts on Air.


Facilities I received while conducting workshops
------------------------------------------------

The colleges which were settled far from my town provided travelling allowance
for me. I accepted because I felt there is nothing wrong in taking such help.
Some colleges arranged an afternoon meal for me. I happily accepted that
because finding another option during short breaks at unknown place is quite
time consuming. There were few colleges which gave cash covers as a good will.
I have decided to not accept such cash because sometimes it comes from the
pocket of students and I don’t feel good to take money from the pocket of any
student. Still some colleges claimed that the money belongs to their grants and
not raised from students. I took that money at that time and donated each to
[Krishna Vrudhashram](http://www.krishnavriddhashram.org/) located at
Gandhinagar, Gujarat.


Python Express
--------------

Such contributions would have not possible without [Python
Express][python_express]. Python Express is a platform to collaborate colleges,
students with Python tutors across India. It is supervised and funded by the
[Python Software Society of India](https://pssi.org.in/).


### Python Express Ahmedabad

At present, we have a Python Express Ahmedabad group whose motive is to teach
Python to nearby colleges. We are linked up with
[Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/). During this PyCon, I got a large
bunch of Python Express stickers from Vijay sir. The stickers will be a lot to
motivate pupils. We also received Python Express volunteer T-shirts. If you are
living nearby Ahmedabad and want to contribute to this movement, please get in
touch over email.

**"Teaching is the best way to learn."**
----------------------------------------

I am inspired from curious questions raised by scholars. They forced me to
plunge deep into the subject. It was little difficult to afford such a huge
hours with having a full time job, but after observing my personal
improvements I consider this as a good investment.

In summary, I took 1 workshop every month during the year 2016 which is nearly
90% more than what I did in the year 2015.

### Do you want to invite me for your college?

First step is to brief your college administration with Python Express to get
the permission. Once they agree register your college at [Python
Express][python_express] and create the workshop request that’s it!

I will advice to schedule workshop on weekends. Saturday is usually the best
day for me. Facilities like Projector, Microphone and speakers if number of
attendees are more than 60. College Computer Labs, the auditorium is the best
place for such events.

Waiting for nice invitations :)
