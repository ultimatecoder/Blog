## Morning

I woke up at 8:30 AM. I took breakfast and then decided to attend Kafka days
Bengaluru.


## First half

I collected a few questions to invest my self in solving them during the event,
but didn't got enough time to solve them. I only focused on solving system
design question. I tried to solve a video streaming system like Youtube or
Hotstar or Netflics.


### Designing YouTube

We can use object storage for storing uploaded videos. Uploaded videos should
be processed to MPEGE-DASH. DASH is Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP is a
protocol which has menifest file and various formats of videos. This protocol
allows to change video according to a bandwidth. There is another standard
called HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) which is compititior with DASH.

Any video can be converted to DASH and HLS using FFMPEG libary. It generates
various menifest files for platform.

There are players who understands DASH at client side like browser or mobile
platform.


## Second half

I applied at Dgraph, Matic and shared my resume to few friends. Let's see what
they are responding.

I am tried and want to sleep like hellp.
