In the modern era of software engineering, terms are coined with a new wrapper.
Such wrappers are required to make bread-and-butter out of it. Sometimes good
marketed terms are adopted as best practices. I was having a lot of confusion
about this Docker technology. Even I was unfamiliar with the concept of
containers. My certain goal was to get a higher level overview first and then
come to a conclusion. I started reading about the Docker from its official
getting started guide. It helped me to host this blog using Docker, but I was
expecting some more in-depth overview. With that reason, I decided to look for
better resources. By reading some Quora posts and Goodreads reviews, I decided
to read “Docker Up & Running by K. Matthias and S. Kane”. I am sharing my
reading experience here.


## TL;DR

The book provides a nice overview of Docker toolchain. It is not a reference
book. Even though few options are deprecated, I will advise you to read this
book and then refer the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) to
get familiar with the latest development.


## Detailed overview

I got a printed copy at nearly 450 INR (roughly rounding to 7 USD, where 1 USD =
65 INR) from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/). The prize is fairly acceptable
with respect to the print quality. The book begins with a little history of containers (Docker is an implementation of the container). Initial chapters give
a higher level overview of Docker tools combining Docker engine, Docker image,
Docker registry, Docker compose and Docker container. Authors have pointed out
situations where Docker is not suitable. I insist you do not skip that topic. I
skipped the dedicated chapter on installing Docker. I will advise you to skip
irrelevant topics because the chapters are not interlinked. You should read
chapter 5 discussing the behavior of the container. That chapter cleared many of
my confusions.  Somehow I got lost in between, but re-reading helped. Such
chapters are enough to get a general idea about Docker containers and images.
Next chapters are focused more on best practices to setup the Docker engine.
Frankly, I was not aware of possible ways to debug, log or monitor containers at
runtime. This book points few expected production glitches that you should keep
in mind. I didn't like the depicted testing workflow by authors. I will look for
some other references which highlight more strategies to construct your test
workflow. If you are aware of any, please share them with me via e-mail. I know
about achieving auto-scaling using various orchestration tools. This book
provides step by step guidance on configuring and using them. Mentioned tools
are [Docker Swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm),
[Centurion](https://github.com/newrelic/centurion) and [Amazon EC2 container
service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Unfortunately, the book is missing
[Kubernets](https://kubernetes.io/) and
[Helios](https://github.com/spotify/helios) here. As a part of advanced topics,
you will find a comparison of various filesystems with a shallow overview of how
Docker engine interacts with them. The same chapter is discussing available
execution drivers and introduces [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) as another
container technology. This API option is deprecated by [Docker version
1.8](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#180-2015-08-11) which
makes [libcontainer](https://github.com/docker/libcontainer) the only dependency. I learned how Docker containers provide
the virtualization layer using [Namespaces][namespaces]. Docker limits the execution of
container using [CGroups (Control
Groups)][cgroups].
[Namespaces][namespaces] and [CGroups][cgroups] are
GNU/Linux level dependencies used by Docker under the hood. If you are an API
developer, then you should not skip Chapter 11. This chapter discusses two
well-followed patterns [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) and [The Reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). These
guidelines are helpful while designing the architecture of your services. The
book concludes with further challenges of using Docker as a container tool.


One typo I found at page number 123, second last line.

```
expore some of the tools...
```

Here, `expore` is a typo and it should be

```
explore some of the tools...
```

I have submitted it to the [official
errata](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errataunconfirmed.csp?isbn=0636920036142).
At the time of writing this post, it has not confirmed by authors. Hope they
will confirm it soon.


### Who should read this book?

* Developers who want to get an in-depth overview of the Docker technology.

* If you set up deployment clusters using Docker, then this book will help you
  to get an overview of Docker engine internals. You will find security and
  performance guidelines.

* This is not a reference book. If you are well familiar with Docker, then this
  book will not be useful. In that case, the Docker documentation is the best
  reference.

* I assume Docker was not supporting Windows platform natively when the book was
  written. The book focuses on GNU/Linux platform. It highlights ways to run
  Docker on Windows using VMs and [Boot2Docker](http://boot2docker.io/) for
  Non-Linux VM-based servers.


### What to keep in mind?

* Docker is changing rapidly. There will be situations where mentioned options
  are deprecated. In such situation, you have to browse the latest Docker
  documentation and try to follow them.

* You will be able to understand the official documentation better after reading
  this book.


## Conclusion

* Your GNU/Linux skills are your Docker skills. Once you understand what the
  Docker is, then your decisions will become more mature.
