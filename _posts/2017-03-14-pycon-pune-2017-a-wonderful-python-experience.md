## tl;dr


## Experience Last month, I attended Pycon Pune 2017. Because I was
volunteering for this conference I reached Pune one day earlier from the
conference days. The volunteer meeting happen at Reserved-bit. Reserved-bit is
the best hacker space I have ever come across. It has large collection of
programmable boards. You will find a boards like RPie, Banaboard, Dragonboard,
Bigalbon, BBC-microbit, the 3D printer as well. More on, this space has great
collection of books on compilers and hardware programming. I managed to found
few on Open source too.  Don't forget to check take a look on book racks they
have. A very decent facility of siting. The owner of the place are very frank.
Both of them are great hackers. You will love to interact with Siddhesh.
Nisha is leading PyLadies community at Pune.

### Pune to Mumbai

I spent my half day at this space. After that I got the responsibility of
picking one of the keynote speakers landing at Mumbai airport midnight. To be
frank estimation of Google map between Pune to Mumbai is wrong. It showed
nearby 2 hours but it took almost 4.5 hours to reach Mumbai. Few more minutes
to reach the airport. The road is impressively smooth. You will encounter
beautiful mountains of Lonavla. The task of moving from Pune to Mumbai airport,
receive Katie and comeback to Pune took completed nearby 13 hours. At 5 AM on
the morning, We managed to reach back to Pune.

### Illness during conference

Because I did huge amount of travelling at night, I was unable to get enough
sleep. Such tiredness resulted as eye infection. I successfully attended first
day of the conference, but I was not in a condition to attend second day.
Treatment of local doctor healed me and I got some energy to take part into Dev
sprints though.

### Conference

The conference was total 4 days where initial two days were for the talks and
end was assigned for a Devsprint. The conference did not bombard with many
talks and multiple unmanaged tracks, but gave quality talks presented on one
hall. The timings was from 9 AM to 5 PM which was taken little lightly by the
attendees.

I was pretty impressed with the keynote speakers of this conference.

#### Katie

Katie is the Orally author. She has written book named "Accessibility Handbook".
She is fun to talk with. She likes to listen on contributing to developer communities, writing and most importantly computer games. Her broad vision on product development is amazing. She is an avid reader. I enjoyed talking on her experience of being in India very first time.

#### Honza

Honza is the dude Django core contributor. He hacks on Python drivers at
the Elastic. He helped to solve few of the complex development I was doing from
past few months. His suggestions on writing code using Django is must to listen. He maintains few vim plugins too.

#### Stephen

Stephen is a professor at (find the university). His knowledge is deep-rooted
just like his beard. You will enjoy discussing on  Computer science, books and
his experience of programming. He is authoring few books written in Japanese.

#### Terri

Terri is a security nerd. She spent most of her time exploring tools at Intel.
She knows how to hide herself from the spying of US government. She is leading
Google Summer of Code section from Python Software Foundation. She is PSF
community service award winner. If you are student and want to take part in GSoC
choosing Python she is the right person to talk.

####Nick

Nick listens more than he speaks. I will advise to not disturb him if he is
coding. He is having great concentration. I enjoyed his mentorship during the
Devsprints. He is contributing to Core Python from few decades. You will enjoy
discussing on interesting code. He is Red Hatter.

####Praveen

Unfortunately I didn't got much time to talk with Praveen during this
conference. He is an Physics teacher who teaches concepts of Physics using
Python programming language. You should feel confident to speak with him on
Python in Education and Physics with him.

####Florence:

His knowledge on ReST API construction is best. He is Falcon nerd
too. I enjoyed discussing on various authentication mechanism for ReST API with
him. He is Red hatter.

#### Jhon
Jhon is the coolest person. His lines are always ends with a humor. He hacks
mostly on hardware and the GNU/Linux. Micro Python and GNU/Linux should be
considered as his part of interest.

I am sad to declare that I was unable to attend any keynote speeches because of
illness. I almost rested at room or talked with people during the conference days. Attending talks didn't helped to get into mood.
