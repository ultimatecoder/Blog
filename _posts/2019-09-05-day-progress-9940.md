## Morning

I woke up around 10:30 AM. I think it has became my daily routine now. After
waking up, I spent reasonable amount of time browsing LinkedIn, talking with my
friend. I took bath, took brunch and reached co-working space around 12:00 PM.

## First Half

I replied to pending emails. Followed up recruiters over email and calls.

Then I improved description of Narad and uploaded system diagram of it. After
uploading system diagram, I talked with Prof. Chhanga and Dhavan individually
over phone call. Explained how I improved Narad for processing large file with
duplicated records.

Then I discussed my approach over a few IRC channels. People suggested various
improvements, and non of them werer related to system design so I have decided
to skim them for now.

I received a task from Locale. Quick skimming tells that this task is exactly
same as what I did for FulFill IO company. If I am interested, I have to
complete this task in one week. I will have to strongly think about my future
with this company.

I applied at uSwitch and one company which is hiring for Germany mentioned by
Chetan.

Yesterday I had planned to solve HR questions during this time. All of my
morning hours are wested in different things. From tomorrow, I will asign
dedicated hours at LinkedIn and emails and focus rest of my day solving
computer science problems.
