## Morning

I woke up at 10:30 AM. Such late morning was because I was slept late Yesterday
night.

### Moun vrat

After waking up, as I have decided Yesterday night, I kept a moun vrat Today. So
far until now, I have broke it 1-2 times and I have spoke very few words. This
is nice because I am doing this after many years. I don't have practice of
avoiding speaking.

## First half

I tried to solve three problems back to back. I forced my self to solve one in
25 minutes. If I am unable to solve it in 25 minutes then I move myself to a
next problem. I will try to solve solve 4 problems back to back, but Today I
solved 3.

Below were problems I tried to solve over board:

1. [Coin Change][coin_change] which is Medium category problem
2. [House Robber][house_robber] which is Easy category problem
3. [Valid Parenthesis][valid_parenthesis] which is Medium category problem

I was unsuccessful in solving any of them. Thanks to this pattern I am able to
evaluate myself better. Previously I was only trying to solve a problem and
tried to count a time, but in an interview they don't provide me infinite amount
of time to solve any problem. In my past experience, I hardly have 20 minutes to
solve any problem in an interview.

One more thing I realised is that after solving one problem I was taking break.
Whereas in interview I was forced to solve 2-3 problem in 45 minutes. To prepare
my self for this situation, I am solved 3 problems back to back. I will try to
solve 4 problems back to back. I am not sure the way I am following is correct
or not. I will try to follow this way for one week and I will measure my daily
progress, improvements to check an outcome of this approach.
