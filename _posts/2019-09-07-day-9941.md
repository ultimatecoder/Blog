## Morning

I woke up around 9:00 AM. I then collected washed clothes, took batch and
rushed to co-working space.


## First half

### Cracking the coding interview solutions

I coded solutions for [Stack
Min](https://github.com/ultimatecoder/cracking_the_coding_interview/blob/master/solutions/stacks_and_queues/stack_min.py#L12)
and [Route between
nodes](https://github.com/ultimatecoder/cracking_the_coding_interview/blob/master/solutions/trees_and_graphs/route_between_nodes.py#L12)
problems from "Cracking the coding interview" book. I tried to write solutions
including test cases in 15 minutes. These solutions at least took 2 timers of 15
minutes. These problems I had solved Yesterday night on pen and paper. By coding
them, I was confirming my solutions.  For "Stack Min" problem, I went with an
approach to store minimum value along with each node of of the stack. That
approach should be considered as brute force approach. I skipped my
implementation of storing minimum number in stacks.  Tomorrow I will try to
implement a version of "Stack min' in which I solve it by storing elements in
another stack.

I solved "Route between nodes" problem with Depth first search approach. In my
view, solving it using DFS will bring a solution quickly, because we don't have
to find shortest route between node. But the author has mentioned that both
approach will be same here.

I was near for solving "Sum Lists" problem, though it took me to implement and
unit test various functions of list. My mind was kind of stuck at recursive
approach and with its arguments.

### Hackerrank problems

I tried solve below Hackerrank problems. I solved them by putting a timer of 15
minutes. There were one which took another 15 minutes. Rest of this task I was
able to solve below 15 minutes.

* [Breaking the * Records](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/breaking-best-and-worst-records/problem)
* [CamelCase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem)
* [Ice Cream Parlor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/icecream-parlor/problem)
* [Marc's Cakewalk](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/marcs-cakewalk/problem)
* [Maximizing XOR](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximizing-xor/problem)

I was not able to solve [Game of Stones](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-stones-1/problem) problem.
It didn't clicked me. People at ##algorithms told me that it can be solved using
simple Dynamic Programming approach.


### Second half

After coming home, I solved 10.1 Sorted Merge problem and 8.3 Magic index
problem from cracking the coding interview book.


## Tomorrow

* I am attending Golang meetup at HotStar.

* Solve Route between nodes problem with Breadth first search approach.
* Solve Sum list problem with recursive approach.
* Solve Game of Stone problem using Dynamic Programming approach.
* Code 10.1 Sorted Merge problem and 8.3 Magic Index problems from cracking the
coding interview book.
* Email NoCodez that you will not be able to attend their interview invitation.
* Email Locale.ai regarding asking status of their funding rounds etc.
* Complete each easy category problem of Data structure category from
Hackerrank.
* Continue solving 1 problem from interview preparation kit from Hackerrank.
* Prepare for one leadership principle of Amazon. Take your notes.
* Learn what is MapReduce and how it is used.
* Solve Leetcode's "SQRTX" problem and "valid perfect square" problem.
* Solve "Root of numbers" problem of Pramp.
