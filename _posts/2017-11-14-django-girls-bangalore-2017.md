TL;DR

Last Sunday, Django girls Bangalore organized a hands-on session of Django.
First time was for Ahmedabad chapter. In this post you will read a small event
report by me.

Django girls is not for profit initiative leaded by Ola Sitarska and Ola
Sendecka. Such movement helps women to learn the skills of website development
using the well known web-framework Django. Django girls community is backed by
world wide organizers. Organizations like The Python Software Foundation, Github
and DjangoProject and many more are funding Django girls.

Django girls Bangalore chapter was organized by Sourav Singh and Kumar Anirudha.
It was my second time mentoring for the Django girls event. First time was for
Ahmedabad chapter. Teach Django is always a joyful task for me. The venue was
sponsored by HackerEarth. X male and 2 women mentored X women in this event.
Each mentor was assigned more or less 3 participants. Introducing newbie with
web development becomes easy with the help of Django girls handbook. The Django
girls handbook is a combination of beginner friendly hands-on tutorials
described in a simple language. The handbook contains tutorials from basics of
Python programming language to deploying your first Web application. Pupils
under me were already ready by configuring Python to their workstation. We
started by introducing our selves. We took some time browsing the website of
undersea cables. Amusing question I got is, "Isn't the world connected with
Satellites?". My team was comfortable with the Python, so we quickly skimmed to
the part where I introduced them with the basics of web and then Django. I
noticed groups were progressing according to their convenience. Nice amount of
time was invested in solving the confusions which is the biggest advantage for
students. A decent lunch was served to all the members. I networked with other
mentors and participants during this time. Post-lunch we created a blog app and
configured it with our project. Introducing them with Django models and ORM took
some time. Such time is required if you are expecting your participants to
understand. With time as a constrain, I focused on admin panel and taught girls
about deploying their website to PythonAnywhere. Unfortunately, allocated time
for venue was near so all decided to terminate our sessions. I am happy with the
hard-work done by my team.

Closing ceremony turned to another amusing event for us. 10 copies of Two scopes
of Django book were distributed to the participants chosen by random draw
strategy. I solemnly thank the authors of the book and Pothi.com for gifting
such nice reference. Participants shared their experiences of the day. Mentors
pinpointed helpful resources to look after. They insisted participants to not
clinch at such point and try for developing and publishing a website with their
own efforts. T-shirts, stickers and badges were distributed as a part of event
swags.

You can find list of all Django girls chapters here. Djangonuts are shouted to
become a mentor for Django girls events of your town. If you are not finding any
in your town, I must insist you to take the responsibility and organise one for
your town. If you are already a part of Django girls community, Why are you not
sharing your experience with others?
