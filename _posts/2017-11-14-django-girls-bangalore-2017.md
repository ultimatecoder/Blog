## TL;DR

Last Sunday, [Django Girls Bangalore][django_girls_bangalore] organized a
hands-on session of web programming. This is a small event report from my side.


## Detailed overview

[Django Girls][django_girls] is not for a profit initiative led by [Ola
Sitarska](http://ola.sitarska.com/) and [Ola
Sendecka](http://blog.sendecka.me/).  Such movement helps women to learn the
skills of website development using the well-known web-framework
[Django][django]. This community is backed by organizers from many countries.
Organizations like The [Python Software
Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), [Github](https://github.com),
[DjangoProject][django] and many [more](https://djangogirls.org/#supporters) are
funding [Django Girls][django_girls].

[Django Girls Bangalore][django_girls_bangalore] chapter was organized by
[Sourav Singh](https://twitter.com/MrSouravSingh) and [Kumar
Anirudha](https://anirudha.org/).  This was my second time mentoring for the
[Django Girls][django_girls] event. First was for the [Ahmedabad
chapter](https://djangogirls.org/ahmedabad/). The venue was sponsored by
[HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com). 8 male and 2 female mentored 21
women during this event. Each mentor was assigned more or less 3 participants.
Introducing participants with web development becomes easy with the help of
[Django Girls handbook][handbook].  The [Django Girls handbook][handbook] is a
combination of beginner-friendly hands-on tutorials described in a simple
language. The [handbook][handbook] contains tutorials on basics of Python
programming language to deploying your web application. Pupils under me were
already ready by pre-configuring Python with their workstation. We started by
introducing our selves. We took some time browsing the
[website](http://submarinecablemap.com/) of undersea cables. One of the amusing
questions I got is, “Isn't the world connected with Satellites?”. My team was
comfortable with the Python, so we quickly skimmed to the part where I
introduced them to the basics of web and then [Django][django]. I noticed
mentors were progressing according to the convenience of participants. Nice
amount of time was invested in discussing raised queries. During illumination,
we heard a loud call for the lunch. A decent meal was served to all the members.
I networked with other mentors and participants during the break. Post-lunch we
created a blog app and configured it with our existing project. Overview of
[Django][django] models topped with the concept of
[ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) became the
arduous task to explain.  With the time as a constraint, I focused on admin
panel and taught girls about deploying their websites to
[PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). I am happy with the hard work
done by my team.  They were able to demonstrate what they did to the world. I
was more joyful than them for such achievement.

The closing ceremony turned amusing event for us. 10 copies of [Two scopes of
Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com) book were distributed to the
participants chosen by random draw strategy.  I solemnly thank the authors of
the book and [Pothi.com](https://pothi.com/) for gifting such a nice reference.
Participants shared their experiences of the day. Mentors pinpointed helpful
resources to look after. They insisted girls to not satisfy at such point and
open their wings by developing websites using skills they learned.  T-shirts,
stickers and badges were distributed as event swags.

You can find the list of all [Django Girls][django_girls] chapters
[here](https://djangogirls.org/events/map/). Djangonauts are shouted to become a
mentor for [Django Girls][django_girls] events in your town. If you are not
finding any in your town, I encourage you to take the responsibility and
organize one for your town. If you are already a part of [Django
Girls][django_girls] community, Why are you not sharing your experience with
others?
