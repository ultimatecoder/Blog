## Morning

I woke up around 10.30 AM. After waking up, I spent almost 2.5 hours watching
Youtube videos. It is clear that I have lost concentration in my life. If I
left Twitter, then my mind is finding any other ways to invest his important
time.


## First half

Finally I got my passport from Post office. I expect police inquiry will go
without any issue too. Now I have to start preparing for Visa procedure.

## Second half

Learnt Trie and spent entire day by watching Youtube videos and reading
wikipedia page of Govinda, Shakti Kapoor, David Dhavan etc.

I don't think I am in a good mental state. I am unable to concentrate. May be
this is because of my less sleep. I will not be able to complete things if I
work like this. I feel I have became too slow for obvious and small things.

I should try waking up early and Pranayama to get my concentration back. I have
to do lot of things in limited amount of time.
