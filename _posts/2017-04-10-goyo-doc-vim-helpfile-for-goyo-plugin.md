### What is Goyo?

[Goyo][goyo] is the vim plugin which allows writers to focus on their writing
while they are writing. The plugin deactivates not required fancy windows which
are not useful at the time of using vim for writing. It provides certain
customizations too.


### What is missing in Goyo?

The main problem with [Goyo][goyo] plugin is that it carries very weak vim
specific helpfile. A vimmer is habituated to find help at vim specific helpfile
first.  After few attempts, I have decided to write a good helpfile for the
[Goyo][goyo] plugin.  I am happy to maintain the documentation I have started
with the ongoing development of the plugin until the author of [Goyo][goyo] is
providing any concise helpfile for it.  The [goyo-doc][goyo-doc] is not carrying
any source of [Goyo][goyo] plugin, but only contains documentation for the
plugin.  I am inviting you to propose improvements if you find any.


### Why I decided to write a separate plugin for documentation?

I believe the documentation is the most important part of any software. While I
was using [Goyo][goyo] plugin, I found it is missing the vim specific helpfile.
I discussed this issue with the author and offered the help for improving on
this.  You can read further about early discussions
[here](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim/issues/144). I didn't get any
positive response from the author so I decided to write and launch vim specific
helpfile for this plugin. With this plugin, I am expecting to provide the
solution to those users who are more familiar with vim specific helpfile than a
Github wiki or README file of any project.  Below are the links for downloading
and using the plugin.
