## TL;DR

[PyDelhi conf 2017][pydelhi_conf_2017] was a two-day conference which served
workshops, a dev sprints, both full-length and lightning talks. If you are a
beginner, this conference is worth attending because there are free workshops.
If you are an experienced developer, then you will surely get advanced level
talks for you. Delhiitee should not miss the chance to attend this conference. I
conducted a workshop titled **“Tango with Django”** helping beginners to
understand the Django web framework.


## Detailed Review


### About the [PyDelhi community][pydelhi_community]

The [PyDelhi community][pydelhi_community] was known as NCR Python Users Group
before few years. This community is performing a role of an umbrella
organization for other FLOSS communities across New Delhi, India. They are
actively arranging monthly [meetups][pydelhi_meetup] on interesting topics. Last
[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2016/) which is a national level conference
of Python programming language was impressively organized by this community.
This year too they took the responsibility of managing it. I am very thankful to
this community for their immense contribution to this society. If you are around
New Delhi, India then you should not miss the chance to attend their
[meetups][pydelhi_meetup]. This community has great people who are always happy
to mentor.

PyDelhi conf is a regional level conference of Python programming language
organized by PyDelhi community. It is their second year organizing this
conference. Last year it was located at [JNU University](www.jnu.ac.in).  This
year it happened at [IIM, Lucknow](https://www.iiml.ac.in/) campus based in
Noida, New Delhi, India. I enjoyed various talks which I will mention later
here, a workshops section because I was conducting one and some the panel
discussions because people involved were having a good level of experience. 80%
of the time slot was divided equally between 30 minutes talk and 2-hour workshop
section.  10% were given to panel discussions and 10% was preserved for
lightning talks.  The dev sprints was happening parallel with the conference. The
early slot was given to workshops for both the days. One large conference hall
was located on a 2nd floor of the building and two halls were at a ground floor.
Food and beverages were served nicely on the base floor.

### Keynote speakers


![Mr.Richardo Rocha]({{site.url}}/assets/images/pydelhi_conf_2017/ricardo.jpg)

* [**Mr.Ricardo Rocha:**](
  https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-rocha-739aa718/?ppe=1) Mr.Rocha is a
  software engineer at [CERN][cern]. I got some time to talk with him
  post-conference. We discussed what are his responsibilities at [CERN][cern]. I
  was impressed when he explained how he is managing infrastructure with his
  team. On inquiring opportunities available at [CERN][cern] he mentioned that
  the organization is always looking for the talented developers.  New grads can
  keep an eye on various Summer Internship Programs which are very similar to
  Google Summer of Code program.

![Mr.Chris Stucchio]({{site.url}}/assets/images/pydelhi_conf_2017/chris.jpg)

* [**Mr.Chris Stucchio:**](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/) Mr.Stucchio is
  director of Data Science at [Wingify/ VWO](https://vwo.com/). I found him
  physically fit compared to other software developers (mostly of India). I
  didn’t get much time to have a word with him. Keynote speech provided by him
  was very much impressive.


### Interesting Talks

Because I took the wrong metro train, I was late for the inaugural ceremony. I
also missed a keynote given by Mr.Rocha. Below talks were impressively
presented at the conference.

* [**Let’s talk about GIL by Mr.Amit Kumar:**](
  https://youtu.be/CwTnUvHo6d8?list=PL3Aq1JLV2oFZFzSGsDUcc6BieBEvUDzJg)
  [Mr.Kumar](http://iamit.in/) discussed various ways to trace threads first and
  then moved the track towards Global Interpreter Lock. He described why the GIL
  is important in [CPython][cpython].

* [**Concurrency in Python 3.0 world - Oh my! by Mr.Anand Pillai:**](
  https://youtu.be/QCZ31d9dqF4?list=PL3Aq1JLV2oFZFzSGsDUcc6BieBEvUDzJg)
  [Mr.Pillai][mr_anand] is well experienced in programming using Python
  language. I like getting his advises on various programming topics. He
  explained how [async][async] IO can be leveraged to boost your programs. I got
  few correct references on understanding latest API of [async][async] library.


* [**Property based testing 101 by Aniket
  Maithani:**](https://youtu.be/n5xUTcsrRns) I always enjoy chit chatting with
  [Mr.Maithani](http://www.aniketmaithani.net/) during conferences. He has jolly
  nature and always prepared with one liner. He discussed various strategies for
  generating a demo data for test cases. I was amazed by his references, tips
  and tricks for generating test data.

I love discussing with people rather than sit in on sessions. With that
ace-reason, I always lose some important talks presented at the conference. I do
not forget to watch them once they are publicly available. This year I missed
following talks.

* [**Optimizing Django for building high-performance systems by Mr.Sanyam
  Khurana**](https://youtu.be/I41LTEWzluU)

* [**Mocking in Python by Mr.Saurabh Kumar**](https://youtu.be/xo9QhfaefzY)


### Volunteer Party

I got a warm invitation by the organizers to join the volunteer party, but I was
little tensed about my session happening on the next day. So, I decided to go
home and improve the slides. I heard from friends that the party was awesome!


### Workshop session by me

![Tango with Django]({{site.url}}/assets/images/pydelhi_conf_2017/talk_2.jpg)

<p class="center"> Me conducting workshop </p>

I conducted a workshop on Django web framework. “Tango with Django” was chosen
as a title with a thought of attracting beginners. I believe this title is
already a name of famous book solving the same purpose.

### Dev sprints

![Dev sprints]({{site.url}}/assets/images/pydelhi_conf_2017/devsprint.jpg)

<p class="center"> Me hacking at dev sprints section </p>

The dev sprints were happening parallel with the conference.
[Mr.Pillai][mr_anand] was representing
[Junction](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction). I decided to test few
issues of [CPython][cpython], but didn’t do much. There were a bunch of people
hacking but didn’t found anything interesting. The quality of chairs were such a
impressive that I have decided to buy the same for my home office.


### Why attend this conference?

* **Free Workshops:** The conference has great slot of talks and workshops.
  Workshops are being conducted by field experts without expecting any other
  fees. This can be one of the great advantages you leverage from this
  conference.

* **Student discounts:** If you are a student then you will receive a discount
  on the conference ticket.

* **Beginner friendly platform:** If you are novice speaker than you will get
  nice mentorship from this community. You can conduct a session for beginners.

* **Networking:** You will find senior employees of tech giants, owner of
  innovative startups and professors from well known universities participating
  in this conference.  It can be a good opportunity for you to network with
  them.


### What was missing?

* **Lecture hall arrangement:** It was difficult to frequently travel to the
  second floor and come back to the ground floor. I ended using staircase most
  of the time, because the elevator was not much species. I found most people
  were spending their time on the ground floor than attending talks going on
  upstairs.

* **No corporate stalls:** Despite having corporate sponsors like Microsoft I
  did’t find any stall of any company.

* **Venue for dev sprints:** The rooms was designed for teleconference
  containing circularly arranged wooden tables. This was not creating a
  collaborative environment. Involved projects were not frequently promoted
  during the conference.


### Thank you PyDelhi community!

I would like to thank all the known, unknown volunteers who performed their best
in arranging this conference. Hoping positive for [PyDelhi][pydelhi_community]
community and encouraging them to arrange such conferences in the future.
