### Introduction


Animal Farm is one of the good books I came across during 2017.  The book is
written in 1945 by English author Eric A. Blair who is more famous by his pen
name George Orwell. Mr. Orwell is well-known for writing a satire on
politicians. The Times ranked him second on a list of "The 50 greatest British
writers since 1945".

Sentences of this book are well composed. I was in the flow of great writing
until the last page. The book consists of fewer than 100 pages and I was able to
complete it in two sittings, but your mileage may vary.


### Plot summary

There is a group of animals who are living together on a farm. The animals are
governed by their owner. One night Old major, who is an old pig in the farm
collects everyone for a meeting. In that meeting, he explains the importance of
liberalization and elaborates that animals of that farm do not have any freedom
to choose their work and food. He inspired them to rebel against their owner by
declaring humans as their enemies. Coincidently Old major died next morning and
that lecture became his last words. The farm united to fight against their
master to take their freedom. They succeed to out the owner from his own farm.
One group of pigs proclaimed themselves as educated and requested
everyone to be allowed to make any decision for the farm. Under
the leadership of two pigs, every animal is happy because they are working for
fellow animals and not for people. In the interim, the owner arrives with a
group of people to take the revenge. It is interesting to read how these
animals fight against that group of humans. They managed to win the battle.
After the victory, an amendment is formed in which humans are considered as
their greatest enemy. The story takes many tragic turns from there on. Pings in
leadership invest their efforts in making their own lifestyle better and do not
pay single attention to the animals. Because the leaders are more literate than
other animals, they portray hypothetical growth in front of little literate or
illiterate animals. Such imaginary growth supported them to create a false faith
in fellow animals. Meanwhile, a small dispute between two leaders took a big
shape. In the fear of losing control, one evil-minded leader assassinated the
other leader. Thus the democracy turned into a dictatorship. The dictator
manifested to advance facilities of the farm. As a part of it, he convinced all
the animals to invest their efforts in constructing a windmill. This force of
animals was previously used to grow food for them. In the meantime, a few other
battles happen with humans. Those fights deteriorated the mill and as
consequence animals broke their morale. It was shocking to read how the head
sold the best of the animal resources to earn money for advancing his
facilities. As an outcome the independent farm started depending again on
humans. Thereupon the farm became bankrupt. Yet the animals are in faith that
the decision made by their captain is in their favor. The struggle continues for
a while and at the end, the chief is bought by humans by giving high bribe to
supply whatever the farm is producing.


### Closing thoughts

The book has inscribed a deep impression on my soul. The effect is so intense
that I am reasoning each sentence spoken by the hegemony. Now onwards, I will
not try to follow any political leader blindly. I am thankful to guru [Xitij
Shukla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xitijshukla/) who inspire me to read this
book. I am so impressed with writing by Mr.  Orwell, that I bought another
popular book [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984)  written
by him. I hope you are liking my blog posts. Please share your views with me at
