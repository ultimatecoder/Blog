## Morning

I woke up around 12:30 PM. It was fucking late. This is because I slept around
2:30 AM Yesterday night. It was because I was doing a lot of other things along
with things which I should do. It was around 1:30 PM when I reached co-working
space after completing brunch.

## First half and Second half

I thought about practicing programs from Leetcode. I thought I should try to
solve other versions of Dynamic programming problems. I picked an easy category
problem in which I had to find maximum sum of sub array. This was already asked
me at Air Asia Hackerrank coding test.

I have already discovered a brute force version to solve this problem. Without
any second thoughts, I applied my that solution. It gave time error. I then
thought to identify any recursive pattern in it.

And I again tried to find any recursive pattern in it. I did this until 9:00 PM.
Yes, even after trying hard and trying various recursive patterns I was getting
time limit errors. I tried to follow Introduction to Algorithm book and its
pages, but it wasn't explaining any pattern for this, or may be I am unable to
get because author has named it differently than what I was looking for.


## Tomorrow

I am thinking to solve exercise of Dynamic Programming from Introduction to
Algorithms book.
